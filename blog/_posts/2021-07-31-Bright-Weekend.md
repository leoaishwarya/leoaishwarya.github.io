- Agar woh humein chodake khuss hai toh shikayat kaisi\
  Ab hum unhein khush bhi na dekhein toh mohabbat kaisi
- Sympathy and Empathy have a narrow line between them, I tried to understand it for a while. Because none of them were kind enough to interfere in this situation.\
  In contrary,\
  Anxiety, vulnerability and agony joined the party as uninvited guests.\
  My real obsession was with honesty, integrity and probity which were just waiting for me to break, but not ready to leave my hand.\
  I crowned my hard work, but it was stolen by guilt, fear and uncertainty.
- I feel great,\
  I feel proud,\
  I feel motivated, and\
  most importantly I feel loved
- Loving with a distance is extraordinary,\
  not every person is worthy of such possession.\
  It keeps you at the edge of life,\
  Thinner the ledge, more you enjoy it,\
  Trust me, its not wishful thinking, its hope, there is a difference.
- Evolving into a better version of yourself after such situation is really rewarding,\
  You win back your self-esteem and destroy any ego.
- I have no regrets, considering that I tried everything\
  I did the right thing and pulled out my best till the end.\
  I kept my promises till very end.\
  I brought my angel everything she asked for,\
  Also let her leave when she wanted to,\
  Meaning of harassment for me was just a word for never letting go.\
  I realised,\
  If it was just my choice to fight, then I cannot continue beyond the wet surface of here tears.\
  I cannot state my existence beyond the furnished floor and glossy windows.\
  I made a statement when It was necessary and at the time when it was adequate.\
  The same statement was picked up, sharpened and sliced me across.
- Today was a day of emotions, realisations and conclusions.
  I still remember the day when we found us, made promises and eventually pictured our future together.\
  Today we found our new existence, intentions and beginnings.\
  I may have the numb feeling for a while, but I have certainly figured out people around us.\
  People definitely wait for opportunity and manipulate the words to fire the final punch.\
  They might have some right intention, but their stories are lost in the world of darkness.\
  Their faces are black, you can't see it clearly.\
  Their voices are loud, but words are really shallow.
- We don't get to choose, who we love and who loves us back\
  Tell her that, you are within her, you are within everything,\
  whether she likes it or not, and she accepts that,\
  and maybe she gets to find her life again\
  be happy, be happy for her,\
  and ultimately the joy will never end.
