Some people believe there is a one,\
The one who points your way to the sun.\
A person they believe makes them complete,\
The one who will support when facing defeat.



You are my angel, my one and only,\
My forever love, so we will never be lonely.\
You have brought to my life all your love and care.\
It made me see when I realised how rare



What you have done, you have illuminated my soul.\
Its you and your love that has made me whole.\
The feel of your love, your soft touch and caress,\
We are tight, so close, your heart beats in my chest.




All that we have always felt missing before.\
Though I love you today, tomorrow it will be more.\
Our love is life, we are the strongest tree,\
Which will always grow forever, like you and me.



You have opened my heart and held it so dear.\
You are my angel and will always keep it near.\
You have seen my ups and cared when I was low.\
You are my angel, I just need you to know.



You entered my life through a ray of sun above,\
And when we leave, we will leave with love.\
My love for you has become my reason to be.\
I hope one day you will find your angel beyond me.



We made it sweet, we kept it long\
Bond between us will be, forever strong\
I have lot to say but the words are short\
Just one promise, we will never keep us apart



Days will pass, hours will fade\
Minutes will fly, memories will be made\
Blink your eye, I will still be here\
Miss me ever, just text me there?

I promise you angel, I will treat you like a dove\
1000 years will pass, But will be still in love

Happy Birthday Angel!!!!!\
May glod blees you with all the Happiness and Success!!!!!
