- She couldn't have asked this from her parents, She tried to, but she failed\
  She couldn't even arrange one meeting with her family,\
  But what she could ask from me, was to upgrade my lifestyle\
  get a better home, a car, a job at a well branded company, a masters degree\
  I completed every demand with no caveats,\
  and ultimately what she could ask from me within a day was termination, Why?\
  Because she loved me, she knew, only I was the person who could understand her,\
  She wanted me to give her the greatest gift, gift of her will and forgiveness\
  She loved me more than her parents, thats why she asked me to take the fall\
  because her parents couldn't do that for her.
- Temperamental incompatibility is just a fancy term.\
  You are incompatible with your parents too, but you stay together, because you love them, right?
- Trust me, you can never find a perfect partner\
  Who only finds good in you, Thinks you are perfect\
  and loves you the way you want them to\
  But you can surely find a person who sees you for who you are,\
  Accepts for who you are with all the imperfections and loves you more than what you wanted them to\
  And thats even better than PERFECT.
- May be one day I will believe that she is defintely happy without me,\
  but one thing I can never believe is that she stopped loving me.\
  I am within her, I am totally in every drop of moment we shared for almost a decade.\
  But, trusting the process has led me to wtiting my thoughts into an oblivion.
- All this is going to end at Death\
  I don't understand people who never think about it, everything is driven by the fact that We are going to die\
  Thats why Art is great, images and videos about the memories feel like dreams,\
  You are capturing a moment, you are like freezing time.\
  because it defies the oblivion of death.
